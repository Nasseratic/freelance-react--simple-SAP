      <p>
          The European Union (EU) is the world's biggest producer of beet sugar and the principal importer of raw cane sugar for refining. While the EU countries have a common market organisation for sugar, the EU has agreements with other countries worldwide on sugar import and export.
          <br/>
          
The EU is the world’s leading producer of beet sugar, with around 50% of the total. However, beet sugar represents only 20% of the world’s sugar production; the other 80% is produced from sugar cane.
          <br/>
          
Most of the EU's sugar beet is grown in the northern half of Europe, where the climate is more suited to growing beet. The most competitive producing areas are in northern France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Poland. The EU also has an important refining industry that processes imported raw cane sugar.
